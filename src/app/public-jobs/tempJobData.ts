These efforts have resulted in notable achievements, such as a 32% female workforce in Europe and a 14% female leadership, along with a 6% reduction in voluntary turnover among female staff.\n- AECOM's employee engagement surveys indicate high satisfaction levels, with a significant majority of employees feeling respected at work and trusting their managers. The company's focus on leadership accountability and the integration of ED&I considerations into project reviews have contributed to a substantial increase in new bids and proposals. Overall, AECOM's strategic approach to inclusion and diversity not only enhances its workforce but also strengthens its ability to meet client needs and drive innovation.\n- Women currently represent 18% of leadership and 33% of workforce.\n- Aim to increase these numbers to at least 20% in leadership and 35% in overall workforce representation.",
